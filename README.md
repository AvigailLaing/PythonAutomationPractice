# Python Automation Scripts

This repository serves as a collection of my Python automation projects.

## Projects Included

### DNS Log Analyzer
This repository includes: **a script that scans a directory of DNS log files, extracts network traffic data using Regular Expressions, and returns a sorted list of all hostnames queried by a specific client IP address.**

### DNS Log Analyzer (Recursive Version)
This repository includes: **a script that recursively scans a directory of DNS log files, extracts network traffic data using Regular Expressions, and returns a sorted list of all hostnames queried by a specific client IP address.**

#### Features:
* Uses `pathlib` to recursively read files.
* Uses `RegEx` to parse complex log formats.
* Filters traffic to isolate a specific user's activity.
